🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to predict house prices based on input features like area, number of bedrooms, and other housing data. It uses regression models and evaluates them based on accuracy and error metrics.

🔍 Features
- Load and clean housing dataset
- Train a regression model (Linear Regression or others)
- Predict house prices based on input features
- Evaluate model using performance metrics

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Components
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Accuracy and error analysis
- Visual representation of predicted vs actual prices
