# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts house prices using regression techniques in machine learning. It uses historical housing data to train models that learn relationships between house features (like area, bedrooms, location, etc.) and their prices. The notebook performs data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, giving insights into the performance.
